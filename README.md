# Table Tennis Rankings

## Why
Because ITTF sucks.

## Info
Barebones ELO ratings based on ITTF tournaments. Not as advanced as RatingsCentral, but it should get the job done.

## Status
Current data fetching scripts do not work, because the ITTF removed their public API so they could start charging a lot for it.
I may find time to go through tournaments manually since 2022 and update values.

## TODO
Fix downloading of ITTF Team Championship matches, ATTU, ETTU.
